            “Share the Love through Music.” That’s our mission. Although AYM is
            comprised of youth high school and middle school students, it is
            full of compassion and service. In hindsight, I am proud of the
            efforts of AYM; we helped our community by performing for senior
            centers, rehabilitation centers, and fundraisers. One distinct
            incident proved to me that we were truly comforting people with
            music. After performing Wonderful Peace and The More Love to Thee an
            elderly woman came up to me. She smiled warmly and said, “ It’s been
            so long since I’ve heard those hymns. Thank you so much for sharing
            them with me.” Later, I met an elderly man and found out that he
            graduated from Leland High School; AYM was not only connecting with
            others through music, but also simply taking the initiative to help
            locals. Initially, I didn’t know if our performances were helping
            anyone’ if it were not for the elderly woman, I would have continued
            to believe our music was meaningless. I know AYM is still young,
            however, I hope it grows and matures, continuing to “share the love
            through music” as I have learned to.

            My experience at AYM has been truly humbling. At first, I joined
            with my brother under the pretense that I was simply going to
            receive community service hours, but it was until after one of our
            performances at the Sunnyvale Senior Center when I learned and
            appreciated the AYM’s selfless intentions. AYM has taught me to be
            grateful for the things I have and to also be aware of people and my
            surroundings. Growing with AYM since its germination has definitely
            given me something to write about for college, but the memories and
            the experiences could never be fully expressed through words and
            lines. So, thank you AYM.

            AYM was an invaluable experience for me as I not only learned of the
            power of music by playing for people living in senior centers and
            nursing homes, but I was also introduced to the different conditions
            in which others around me were living. I had expected live music to
            be a definite part of everyone’s lives - something that surely
            everyone would have access to. However, while going around and
            playing my repertoire to those nearby me, I realized how much of a
            privilege it was for me to be able to not only hear, but also play
            music that people can enjoy. After playing at nursing homes, the
            residents always welcomed me with warm applause, and it was truly
            gratifying to see them be comforted with the melodies that I could
            share with them. I am blessed to be a part of AYM, and I hope it
            continues to grow and spread music around with each and every
            passing year!

            Joining AYM was probably one of the best decisions I have made since
            coming to America. Through all the performances and volunteer
            events, I discovered the potential of sharing something as simple as
            music with others. You can see it in the faces of our audiences
            after every piece; we are giving them something truly special that
            they will remember for a long time. Participating in AYM has taught
            me to always look for opportunities to bless others in my daily
            live; the smallest of kind gestures could make someone’s day. I will
            never forget all the things we did and all the great people I met
            here. Thank you for giving me this opportunity to play my instrument
            to help others.{" "}
